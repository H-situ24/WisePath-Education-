          <p class="mt-3">Pursuing a career in law is a popular choice for many students in India, offering diverse opportunities in fields such as litigation, corporate law, cyber law, environmental law, and intellectual property. At Wise Path Education, we provide guidance for law admissions at undergraduate (UG), postgraduate (PG), and doctoral (PhD) levels, helping students make informed decisions based on their career goals and interests.</p>
          <h3 class="mt-3 text-warning">Undergraduate Law Programs (UG)</h3>
          <p class="mt-3">Students who have completed their higher secondary education (10+2) can pursue integrated law programs such as BA LLB, BBA LLB, or B.Sc. LLB, which combine a bachelor’s degree with an LLB in a five-year course. Alternatively, those who have completed a bachelor’s degree in any discipline can opt for a three-year LLB program.</p>
