            <u style="color: #fda31b">Why Choose Russia for MBBS?</u>
          </h3>
          <ul class="mt-3">
            <h4 class="mt-3">1. Recognized Medical Universities</h4>
            <li>
              Russia is home to several medical universities recognized by WHO,
              NMC, and other international medical councils, ensuring that the
              degree is valid globally. Graduates can practice medicine in their
              home countries after passing the necessary licensing exams.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <ul class="mt-3">
            <h4 class="mt-3">2. Affordable Tuition Fees</h4>
            <li>
              Tuition fees in Russia are relatively lower compared to Western
              countries. Fees generally range from $4,000 to $10,000 per year,
              depending on the university.
            </li>
            <li class="mt-3">
              The cost of living is also reasonable, with monthly expenses
              averaging $200 to $400, including accommodation and food.
            </li>
          </ul>

              including five years of academic study followed by a one-year
              internship. The medium of instruction is usually English for
              international students.
            </li>

            <li>
              The admission process is straightforward, with most universities
              not requiring entrance exams. Students need to have completed high

              Indian students are required to pass NEET to practice in India
              after graduation.
            </li>
            <li class="mt-3">
              After receiving the offer letter, students apply for a student
              visa with the assistance of their chosen university.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <ul class="mt-3">
            <h4 class="mt-3">5. International Exposure</h4>

            <li>
              While studying in Russia offers many advantages, there may be
              challenges such as adjusting to the local language (Russian)
              during clinical practice, as many locals may not speak English.
              However, universities typically offer language courses.
            </li>
            <li class="mt-3">
              Graduates must also pass exams like FMGE (India), USMLE (USA), or

                Russia, the largest country in the world, spans Eastern Europe

                Historically, Russia has been a major player on the world stage,
                from the powerful Tsardom and the Russian Empire to the Soviet
                Union, which significantly influenced global politics, culture,
                and economics. Following the dissolution of the USSR in 1991,
                Russia emerged as an independent nation and has since undergone
                substantial political and economic transformations, striving for
                stability and modernization.

                literature, music, and ballet, producing notable figures like
                Leo Tolstoy, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and Pyotr Tchaikovsky. The
                country boasts a wealth of natural beauty, from the vast
                Siberian wilderness and the majestic Ural Mountains to the
                stunning Lake Baikal, the deepest lake in the world. These
                natural wonders make Russia a unique destination for outdoor
                enthusiasts and tourists alike.

            Kyrgyzstan, a Central Asian country with a population of
            approximately 6.6 million as of 2023, has a relatively young and
            growing population compared to some neighboring countries. However,
            it is also experiencing demographic shifts with increasing
            urbanization and rural-to-urban migration, primarily toward the
            capital, Bishkek.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-3">
            The majority of the population is ethnically Kyrgyz, but the country
            is also home to significant Uzbek, Russian, and other minority
            communities. The country has a high fertility rate compared to
            global standards, contributing to a steady population growth,
            although economic factors have led to many citizens seeking work
            abroad, especially in Russia.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-3">
            Urbanization and migration are reshaping the social and economic
            landscape of Kyrgyzstan. While the population is young, with a large
            proportion under 30, challenges such as job creation, infrastructure
            development, and access to education and healthcare remain critical

              Indian students who wish to study MBBS abroad, including Russia,
              must qualify for the NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance
              Test). The NEET exam ensures that students are eligible to study
