            <h4 class="mt-3">1. Recognized Medical Universities</h4>
            <li>
              Kazakhstan is home to several medical universities recognized by
              WHO, NMC, and other international medical councils, ensuring that
              the degree is valid globally. Graduates can practice medicine in

              year, depending on the university.
            </li>
            <li class="mt-3">
              The cost of living is also reasonable, with monthly expenses

            </li>
            <li class="mt-3">

            </li>
          </ul>

          <ul class="mt-3">

              While studying in Kazakhstan offers many advantages, there may be
              challenges such as adjusting to the local language (Kazakh and
              Russian) during clinical practice, as many locals may not speak
              English. However, universities typically offer language courses.
            </li>
            <li class="mt-3">

                Kazakhstan, the largest landlocked country in the world, is
                located in Central Asia and spans both Eastern Europe and
                Northern Asia. Known for its diverse landscapes that range from
                steppes and deserts to mountains and forests, Kazakhstan boasts
                a rich history and cultural heritage. It shares borders with
                Russia, China, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan, making
                it a significant hub for trade and cultural exchange in the
                region.

                Historically, Kazakhstan has been home to various nomadic tribes
                and has played a vital role along the Silk Road, connecting East
                and West. The country gained independence from the Soviet Union
                in 1991 and has since been working towards economic
                modernization and political stability, emerging as one of the
                leading economies in Central Asia.

                Russians, and others. The country has a vibrant tradition of
                music, dance, and oral literature, with notable figures such as
                the poet Abai Qunanbaiuly. Additionally, Kazakhstan's stunning
                natural landscapes, such as the Charyn Canyon, the Altai
                Mountains, and the vast steppes, make it an attractive
                destination for outdoor enthusiasts and tourists alike.

          <p>
            Kazakhstan, the largest country in Central Asia, has a population of
            approximately 19 million as of 2023. The country has a diverse and
            dynamic demographic structure, characterized by a mix of ethnicities
            and a growing urban population. Rapid urbanization is particularly
            evident in major cities such as Almaty and Nur-Sultan (formerly
            Astana), where many people migrate in search of better economic
            opportunities.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-3">
            The population is predominantly ethnic Kazakh, but there are
            significant Russian, Uzbek, Ukrainian, and other minority
            communities. Kazakhstan has a relatively moderate fertility rate
            compared to some of its neighbors, contributing to gradual
            population growth. Economic development and improved living
            standards have also encouraged some citizens to return from abroad,
            particularly from Russia.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-3">
            As Kazakhstan continues to modernize, it faces challenges related to
            population distribution, employment, and social services. With a
            considerable proportion of the population under 30, the country must
            focus on job creation, infrastructure development, and access to
            education and healthcare to meet the needs of its young citizens.

              Indian students who wish to study MBBS abroad, including
              Kazakhstan, must qualify for the NEET (National Eligibility cum
              Entrance Test). The NEET exam ensures that students are eligible
              to study medicine abroad and practice in India after completing

              (Foreign Medical Graduates Examination) or NEXT (National Exit
