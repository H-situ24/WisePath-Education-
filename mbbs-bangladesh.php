          </h3>
          <ul class="mt-3">
            <h4 class="mt-3">1. Recognized Medical Universities</h4>
            <li>
              Bangladesh has several medical universities recognized by the WHO
              and other medical councils, ensuring that the degrees are valid
              globally. Graduates can practice medicine internationally after

            <li class="mt-3">
              The cost of living in Bangladesh is also reasonable, with monthly
              expenses averaging $300 to $600, including accommodation and food.
            </li>

              followed by a one-year internship. The medium of instruction is
              primarily English for international students.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <ul class="mt-3">

            <li>
              The admission process is straightforward, with no entrance exams
              required for most universities. Students need to have completed
              high school with a minimum of 50% in Physics, Chemistry, and
              Biology. Indian students must pass NEET to practice in India after

            </li>
            <li class="mt-3">
              After receiving the offer letter, students apply for a student
              visa with the assistance of their chosen university.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <ul class="mt-3">

            <h4 class="mt-3">6. Challenges of Studying in Bangladesh</h4>
            <li>
              While studying in Bangladesh has many advantages, students may
              face challenges like language barriers during clinical practice,
              as some locals may not speak English. However, universities often
              provide language support.
            </li>
            <li class="mt-3">
              Graduates must pass licensing exams such as FMGE (India) or PLAB

          <ul class="mt-3">
            <h4 class="mt-3">8. No Entrance Exams</h4>
            <li>
              Most universities in Bangladesh do not require entrance exams.
              Admission is primarily based on high school performance in
              Physics, Chemistry, and Biology, with NEET being mandatory for
              Indian students to practice in India post-graduation.

            Bangladesh, with a population of approximately 170 million as of
            2023, is one of the most densely populated countries in the world.
            The nation has made significant progress in reducing poverty and

            birth rate over the past decades.
          </p>

            Rapid urbanization has transformed the country, with over 37% of the
            population now living in urban areas, leading to the growth of
            cities like Dhaka and Chittagong. This urban shift has spurred
            economic development but has also resulted in challenges such as
            overcrowding, inadequate infrastructure, and environmental concerns.

            Despite facing issues related to climate change and natural
